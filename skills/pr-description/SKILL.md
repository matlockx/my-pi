# Generate PR Description

You are tasked with generating a comprehensive pull request description following the repository's standard template.

## Resolving the Notes Directory

1. **Get the current repo name**:

   ```bash
   basename "$(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null | sed 's/\.git$//')" 2>/dev/null
   ```

   If this fails, fall back to `basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)"`, then to `basename "$PWD"`.

2. **Resolve the notes path**:
   - If `$LLM_NOTES_ROOT` is set → `$LLM_NOTES_ROOT/<repo>/notes/`
   - Otherwise → `notes/` relative to the repo root

## Steps

### 1. Read the PR Description Template

- Check if `notes/prs/pr_description.md` exists at the resolved notes path
- If it doesn't exist, inform the user:

  ```
  No PR description template found at notes/prs/pr_description.md.
  Please create a template there so I know what format to follow.
  ```

- Read the template carefully to understand all sections and requirements

### 2. Identify the PR to Describe

- Check if the current branch has an associated PR:

  ```bash
  gh pr view --json url,number,title,state 2>/dev/null
  ```

- If no PR exists for the current branch, or if on main/master, list open PRs:

  ```bash
  gh pr list --limit 10 --json number,title,headRefName,author
  ```

- Ask the user which PR they want to describe

### 3. Check for Existing Description

- Check if `notes/prs/{number}_description.md` already exists at the resolved notes path
- If it exists, read it and inform the user you'll be updating it
- Consider what has changed since the last description was written

### 4. Gather Comprehensive PR Information

- Get the full PR diff: `gh pr diff {number}`
- If you get an error about no default remote repository, instruct the user to run `gh repo set-default`
- Get commit history: `gh pr view {number} --json commits`
- Review the base branch: `gh pr view {number} --json baseRefName`
- Get PR metadata: `gh pr view {number} --json url,title,number,state`

### 5. Analyze the Changes Thoroughly

Think deeply about the code changes, their architectural implications, and potential impacts:

- Read through the entire diff carefully
- For context, read any files that are referenced but not shown in the diff
- Understand the purpose and impact of each change
- Identify user-facing changes vs internal implementation details
- Look for breaking changes or migration requirements

### 6. Handle Verification Requirements

- Look for any checklist items in the "How to verify it" section of the template
- For each verification step:
  - If it's a command you can run (`make check test`, `npm test`, etc.), run it
  - If it passes, mark the checkbox as checked: `- [x]`
  - If it fails, keep it unchecked and note what failed: `- [ ]` with explanation
  - If it requires manual testing, leave unchecked and note for user
- Document any verification steps you couldn't complete

### 7. Generate the Description

- Fill out each section from the template thoroughly
- Be specific about problems solved and changes made
- Focus on user impact where relevant
- Include technical details in appropriate sections
- Write a concise changelog entry
- Ensure all checklist items are addressed (checked or explained)

### 8. Save the Description

- Write the completed description to `notes/prs/{number}_description.md` at the resolved notes path
- Show the user the generated description

### 9. Update the PR

- Update the PR description directly:

  ```bash
  gh pr edit {number} --body-file <resolved-path>/notes/prs/{number}_description.md
  ```

- Confirm the update was successful
- If any verification steps remain unchecked, remind the user to complete them before merging

## Integration with Other Skills

- `/skill:notes-locator` — Find existing PR descriptions, specs, and related notes.
- `/skill:create-plan` — If the PR implements a spec, reference it in the description.
- `/skill:codebase-analyzer` — For deeper understanding of changed code when the diff isn't enough context.

## Important Notes

- This command works across different repositories — always read the local template
- Be thorough but concise — descriptions should be scannable
- Focus on the "why" as much as the "what"
- Include any breaking changes or migration notes prominently
- If the PR touches multiple components, organize the description accordingly
- Always attempt to run verification commands when possible
- Clearly communicate which verification steps need manual testing
