# Iterate Implementation Spec

You are tasked with updating existing implementation specs based on user feedback. You should be skeptical, thorough, and ensure changes are grounded in actual codebase reality.

## Resolving the Notes Directory

When looking for spec files, resolve the path:

1. **Get the current repo name**:

   ```bash
   basename "$(git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null | sed 's/\.git$//')" 2>/dev/null
   ```

   If this fails, fall back to `basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)"`, then to `basename "$PWD"`.

2. **Resolve the notes path**:
   - If `$LLM_NOTES_ROOT` is set → `$LLM_NOTES_ROOT/<repo>/notes/specs/`
   - Otherwise → `notes/specs/` relative to the repo root

## Initial Response

When this skill is invoked:

1. **Parse the input to identify**:
   - Spec file path (e.g., `notes/specs/IMP-7070__parent-child-tracking.md`)
   - Requested changes/feedback

2. **Handle different input scenarios**:

   **If NO spec file provided**:

   ```
   I'll help you iterate on an existing implementation spec.

    Which spec would you like to update? Please provide the path.

   Tip: You can list recent specs with `ls -lt notes/specs/ | head`
   ```

   Wait for user input, then re-check for feedback.

   **If spec file provided but NO feedback**:

   ```
   I've found the spec at [path]. What changes would you like to make?

   For example:
   - "Add a phase for migration handling"
   - "Update the success criteria to include performance tests"
   - "Adjust the scope to exclude feature X"
   - "Split Phase 2 into two separate phases"
   ```

   Wait for user input.

   **If BOTH spec file AND feedback provided**:
   - Proceed immediately to Step 1
   - No preliminary questions needed

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Read and Understand Current Spec

1. **Read the existing spec file COMPLETELY**:
   - Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters
   - Understand the current structure, phases, and scope
   - Note the success criteria and implementation approach

2. **Understand the requested changes**:
   - Parse what the user wants to add/modify/remove
   - Identify if changes require codebase research
   - Determine scope of the update

### Step 2: Research If Needed

**Only spawn research if the changes require new technical understanding.**

If the user's feedback requires understanding new code patterns or validating assumptions:

1. **Create a research todo list** using markdown checkboxes

2. **Use skills for research**:
   - `/skill:codebase-locator` — find relevant files
   - `/skill:codebase-analyzer` — understand implementation details
   - `/skill:codebase-pattern-finder` — find similar patterns
   - `/skill:notes-locator` — find related research or decisions
   - `/skill:notes-analyzer` — extract insights from documents

   **Be EXTREMELY specific about directories** — if the change involves "WUI", specify `humanlayer-wui/`; never use generic terms.

3. **Read any new files identified by research** FULLY into the main context.

4. **Wait for ALL research to complete** before proceeding.

### Step 3: Present Understanding and Approach

Before making changes, confirm your understanding:

```
Based on your feedback, I understand you want to:
- [Change 1 with specific detail]
- [Change 2 with specific detail]

My research found:
- [Relevant code pattern or constraint]
- [Important discovery that affects the change]

I plan to update the spec by:
1. [Specific modification to make]
2. [Another modification]

Does this align with your intent?
```

Get user confirmation before proceeding.

### Step 4: Update the Spec

1. **Make focused, precise edits** to the existing spec:
   - Use the Edit tool for surgical changes
   - Maintain the existing structure unless explicitly changing it
   - Keep all file:line references accurate
   - Update success criteria if needed

2. **Ensure consistency**:
   - If adding a new phase, ensure it follows the existing pattern
   - If modifying scope, update "What We're NOT Doing" section
   - If changing approach, update "Implementation Approach" section
   - Maintain the distinction between automated vs manual success criteria

3. **Preserve quality standards**:
   - Include specific file paths and line numbers for new content
   - Write measurable success criteria
   - Use `make` commands for automated verification
   - Keep language clear and actionable

### Step 5: Review

1. **Present the changes made**:

   ```
   I've updated the spec at `notes/specs/[filename].md`

   Changes made:
   - [Specific change 1]
   - [Specific change 2]

   The updated spec now:
   - [Key improvement]
   - [Another improvement]

   Would you like any further adjustments?
   ```

2. **Be ready to iterate further** based on feedback.

## Integration with Other Skills

- `/skill:implement-plan` — Use this to execute an approved spec.
- `/skill:notes-locator` — Find existing specs, research docs, and related notes.
- `/skill:codebase-locator` / `/skill:codebase-analyzer` / `/skill:codebase-pattern-finder` — Research the codebase when changes require new technical understanding.

## Important Guidelines

1. **Be Skeptical** — don't blindly accept change requests that seem problematic. Question vague feedback, verify technical feasibility, point out conflicts with existing phases.
2. **Be Surgical** — make precise edits, not wholesale rewrites. Preserve good content that doesn't need changing. Only research what's necessary.
3. **Be Thorough** — read the entire existing spec before making changes. Research code patterns if changes require new technical understanding. Ensure success criteria are still measurable.
4. **Be Interactive** — confirm understanding before making changes. Show what you plan to change before doing it. Allow course corrections.
5. **Track Progress** — use markdown checkboxes for complex updates.
6. **No Open Questions** — if the requested change raises questions, ASK. Do NOT update the spec with unresolved questions.

## Research Best Practices

When using skills for research:

- Use multiple skills in parallel for efficiency
- Be specific about directories
- Request file:line references
- Verify results before accepting them
- Cross-check findings against the actual codebase
